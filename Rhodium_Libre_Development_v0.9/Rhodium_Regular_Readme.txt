Rhodium Regular Readme

Rhodium Regular is a font developed by James Puckett of Dunwich Type Founders. It is released under the SIL Open Font License Version 1.1: http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL_web

Rhodium was designed for use on screens at small sizes. To that end, it has a large x-height, wide letters, open counters, etc. etc. The Devanagari is the same height as the latin capitals to allow it to stand alongside the oversized latin lowercase.

Historical models for Rhodium’s design are Fortune (AKA Volta), by Konrad Bauer and Walter Baum, and Rex, by Intertype.

Rhodium’s Latin glyph complement supports Adobe’s Latin-3 character set. For more information about Adobe character sets see: http://blog.typekit.com/2008/08/28/extended_latin

Rhodium’s Devanagari glyph complement supports contemporary Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali.

Rhodium was developed and compiled using a beta version of Glyphs 2 by Georg Seifert.
