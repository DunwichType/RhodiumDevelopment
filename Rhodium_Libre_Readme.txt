Rhodium is a typeface designed for small sizes on low resolution screens. To that end it is wide with a very large latin x-height, open counters, and loose spacing. The Devanagari is fairly tall in comparison to the roman. The design is generally simple and coarse without small details that would be lost on screens; this also limits file sizes. 

Rhodium is based on three designs. The primary influence is Fortuna/Fortune/Volta by Konrad Bauer. Intertype Rex and Matthew Carterâ€™s Verdana provided models for type designed for small sizes and adverse reading environments.

The Rhodium regular development files are released under the SIL Open Font License version 1.1: http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL_web
